# The Digital World is Overwhelming
In an effort to live a more meaningful and hands-on lifestyle, I bought a minivan and transformed it into a camper minivan with my own hands. Building out my home-on-wheels has been an obsession of mine since December of 2022, and I currently travel around wtih it visiting friends and exploring wherever I would like to explore.
